    "Specifically, in Section 1, we will work with a **feedforward neural network** (also known as a **multi-layer perceptron**) implemented solely in numpy, reflect on the associated details of the **forward** pass and implement the **backpropagation** parts of our layers to train our MLP. In Section 2, we will independently look at some gradient-based optimization techniques that are popular with convex functions and have been shown to be useful in finding sufficiently satisfactory optima on the loss manifolds on parametrized models. \n",

    "This assignment is aimed at leaving you with a very solid understanding of how backpropogation works in the context of a Neural Network.

    "On correct completion, you will be able to successfully train your MLP for any classification problem where the input feature vector is relatively low-dimensional. We've provided code that pre-processes and trains your MLP on the **Red Wine Classification** dataset for binary-classification. This is to enable you to quickly run and test your MLP. \n",

    "You now have intuition for how the backpropagation procedure updates every single node or layer in the neural network with the gradient of the loss function with respect to the specific parameters. Luckily, you will not have to repeat this tedious enumeration in the future as autograd packages can help you track and organize the gradient tracking process. Even better, most modern neural network libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow have their own autograd versions which abstract gradient calculations into a single function call on your loss function, instantly tracking along a computational neural network graph to quickly update gradients. \n",
    "\n",
    "Equally important to the machine learning pipeline is the process of optimization: actually using the calculated **gradient** at the current values and moving to the next values, which are closer to the optimal arguments to our function. A version of **stochastic gradient descent** was already used in section 1 to train the multilayer perceptron.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a perfect world, once we have an analytical formulation for the gradient of a function, we can go back to the classic technique from Calc 2/Calc 3 of setting the gradient to 0 and calculating the values of the variables at the optimal location. Indeed take \n",

    "However, this technique does not work well with most functions: it is the exception rather than norm to set values to 0 to get and classify the optima. Moreover as the order of the partial derivatives increases, the resulting polynomials become harder and harder to solve (even if a solution is possible) and the problem quickly becomes computationally intractable. Second order methods (Hessian matrices) are required to further classify if these points are in any way useful (saddle points for example would be severely detrimental stopping points for our optimization problem) and are notoriously difficult computationally. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will now proceed to look at some well-known gradient-based iterative algorithms that have successfully been deployed in training deep learning models. In a typical machine learning pipeline, these optimizers will only be useful after the backpropagation stage is complete. At this stage we have that the network parameters $\\theta$ have an associated gradient with respect to the loss $\\frac{\\delta\\mathcal{L}}{\\delta\\theta}$. This step involves using the gradient to nudge $\\theta$ towards an optimum value, i.e, the $\\theta$ that would yield the lowest possible loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, loss functions that are encountered in neural networks are parametrized by hundreds, thousands and millions of parameters, and hence it is not always easy to visualize or study the exact properties of optimization algorithms on them. Typically such optimization functions are designed for **convex** functions, which are characterized, amidst others by **Jensen's inequality**, meaning that the function always lies below any surface connecting two points on this surface, or precisely for a function $f: X \\mapsto Y$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(\\theta \\vec{x} + (1 - \\theta)\\vec{y}) \\leq \\theta \\vec{x} + (1 - \\theta)\\vec{y}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for $x, y \\in X$ and $0 \\leq \\theta \\leq 1$. In $\\mathbb{R}^3$ the **bowl** or **sphere** function is the archetypical convex function.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "While convex theory gives convenient bounds on gradient based optimization, it is not enough to stop here as we do not expect the loss function for our machine learning models to be convex. Optimization research then focuses on studying the behavior of algorithms on test functions that accentuate some of the possible problematic optimization scenarios we might run into on a loss manifold in higher dimensions. For example, one potential issue we have studied in class is that in an iterative optimization process, we might get stuck in a local optima. A potential test function that could especially be indicative of if an optimization algorithm handles this issue, is the following function, which we will call the **mult** function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x, y) = \\sin(\\sqrt(x^2 + y^2)) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Another issue could be a point which has different signs to its curvature in different directions, but locally has no gradient, aka a saddle point. A \"test\" function to effectively evaluate an algorithm's performance on saddle points could be \n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x, y) = x^3 + 3x y^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "or otherwise known as the **monkey saddle**. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a final example, it might be concerning if a point has a very high gradient in one direction but extremely low gradient aka a high condition number is associated with its eigendecomposition of the Hessian (if you didn't understand this last line, that's fine- the Hessian only comes into play while giving a proof of convergence for convex functions for gradient descent and such theory is beyond the scope of this class. An alternate way of thinking why this is an issue is because it will cause a zig-zag convergence to the optima when we can potentially save a lot of iterations by just taking a step along one axis). A function to test convergence performance emperically for this issue could be one shaped like a taco shell. A well known function of this kind is the **Matyas** function.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x, y) = 0.26(x^2 + y^2) -0.48xy$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Bonus point for figuring out who the **Matyas** function is named after, because I looked forever in the hopes of adding a half-clever note on who Matyas was to improve the readability of this homework with a casual fun fact that has nothing to do with machine learning, but I ended up getting lost online and achieving nothing for 30 mins."

    "The use of the word momentum is a metaphor in this context, as such a method allows the navigation of shallow local optima or the navigation of ravines using the build-up of gradients from the navigation. The idea is that we maintain what is a 'velocity' term $\\nu$ at each timestep that keeps track of how much gradient has so far been encountered. Hence this value builds up in each direction and even in cases when gradients received in training are poor (eg. around saddle points, or local minima), the algorithm is able to escape such points (much like a ball rolling down a hill). The term for gamma, which is a hyperparameter, can be thought of as friction for the build-up of this velocity, as it decides how much of the previous velocity to count at a certain timestep. Even in the case of a ravine, the zig-zag motion of stochastic gradient descent would reduce as the buildup term in one direction would carry us smoothly through the low-gradient sensitive dimension. The momentum vectors also help cancel/smooth some of the noise that results from approximating gradients using a single data point, aka, the stochastic way.\n",

Such minima are not desirable even as global minima, as on a data manifold they may be \"too good\" to be true; representative of a kind of overfit. An example test function for this issue is the **Easom function**. The good news is that with some tuning of **gamma** more often that never SGD + momentum will settle in shallow, wide minima."
